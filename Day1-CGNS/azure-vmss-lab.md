**Module  2 – Configuring CME on the Smart Center Server**


1.	Log into Check Point Smart Console, create a Simple policy called Standard-vmss, with a single rule as Any, Any, Accept, Log rule, and publish the changes
2.	SSH into the Check Point Smart Center with the Putty client.
3.	Create the command to configure CME on the Smart Center:

Example:
```shell
autoprov-cfg init Azure -mn “<management-name>” -tn “<configuration-template-name>” -otp “<SIC-key>” -ver “R81.20/R82” -po “<policy-name>” -cn “<controller-name>” -sb “<azure-subscription>” -at “<active-directory-tenant-id>” -aci “<client-id>” -acs “<client-secret>”
```
Command explained:

|Items|Parameters|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`<management-name>`|Select a name you can identify. Could be any name you like.<br><br>**This is what was used using the VMSS Deployment**|CP-management|
|`<configuration-template-name>`|Give a name to represent this template. If you deploy other templates you will use another unique name<br><br>**This is what was used using the VMSS Deployment**|Azure-Lab-Template|
|`<SIC-key>`|One-time password for sic<br><br>**This is what was used using the VMSS Deployment**|Checkpoint123|
|-ver|VMSS version (R81.20/R82)<br><br>**The version of CheckPoint VMSS was used during the deployment**|R81.20/R82|
|`<policy-name>`|Name of you policy you will use<br><br>**The policy name that was created above**|Standard-vmss|
|`<controller-name>`|Name of your Azure connection. If you have multiple connections. This needs to be unique|Azure-Lab|
|`<azure-subscription>`|Your subscription ID from the above<br><br>**Copied in your notepad from earlier**|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-x|
|`<active-directory-tenant-id>` aka **Directory ID**|Your tenant ID from above<br><br>**Copied in your notepad from earlier**|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-x|
|`<client-id>`  <br>aka **Application ID**|Your client ID from above<br><br>**Copied in your notepad from earlier**|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-x|
|`<client-secret>`  <br>aka (Application **Key)**|Your client's secret from above<br><br>**Copied in your notepad from earlier**|*******|

Command example:

```bash
autoprov-cfg init Azure -mn "CP-managment" -tn "Azure-Lab-Template" -otp "Checkpoint123" -ver “R81.20” -po "Standard-vmss" -cn "Azure-Lab" -sb "da551519-1bd8-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx " -at "c82f513e-c21f-4a87-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx " -aci "e69452bc-4be8-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx" -acs “YO9E2STVZfn+umgHwG9lYQnhuvDIixxxxxxxxxx=”
```

4.	On the Smart Center Putty session go into Expert mode:


```bash
cpmgmt> expert
Login with the admin password: Checkpoint123!
```

NOTE: You may need to set the expert password 

```bash
cpmgmt> set expert password
[you will be prompted to type and confirm your password]
[Expert@cpmgmt:0]save config
```

5.	Past the autoprov-cfg command into the Putty session
6.	Verify the command successfully communicates to Azure by running the command:

```service cme test```

This will test to ensure communication to the Cloud env (Azure) is working and proper permissions are provided. Ensure it comes back as All Tests passed successfully

7.	Run the following command to view the cme.log file and monitor if the VMSS gateways are detected and being deployed in the Smart Center:

```bash
[Expert@cpmgmt:0]tail -f /var/log/CPcme/cme.log
```

8.	In your Check Point Smart Console, watch/verify that the Gateways are added automatically and the Standard-VMSS policy is installed

### Module  3 – VMSS network configuration


By default, the template you deploy creates an external (Internet-facing) Load Balancer that:

Listens on TCP port 80 on the static public IP address of the external Load Balancer.
Forwards the traffic it receives to the pool of Check Point CloudGuard Security Gateways on TCP port 8081.

In this lab, we will continue to use the default assigned Public IP and TCP service. We configure the environment to properly load balance traffic behind a group of Web servers.

Steps:
1.	Add a new App subnet to the VMSS vNet
2.	Deploy two NGINX VMs in Azure in the App subnet
3.	Create a Web backend LB for the VM

### Module  5 –  Create a Policy to allow Web server connectivity


1.	Open Smart Console and create two Dynamic Objects called LocalGatewayExternal and LocalGatewayInternal.

NOTE: The two objects' names need to be 100% as outlined above (Pascal Case)

Create a Host object in Smart Console for the VMSS-App-Workload VM. 

Example: 
- Name: VMSS-App-Workload
-	Ip: 10.21.0.4

2.	Create a custom service. The default in this lab will be TCP-8083. It is recommended to clone the HTTP service and modify the port.

3.	Create a corresponding firewall rule for each external Load Balancer with these values:
- Source: *Any
- Destination: LocalGatewayExternal
- Services: The service that represents the internal port (8083)
 

4.	Create a NAT rule with the values below. Make a rule for each Azure External Load Balancer.
- Original Source: All_Internet (do not use Any)
- Original Destination: LocalGatewayExternal
- Original Services: The service you created
- Translated Source: LocalGatewayInternal
- Right-click on the cell and set the NAT method to Hide
- Translated Destination: The Host object that represents the internal WebServer (VMSS-App-Workload)
- This can be any service that represents the port the App is listening for.

5.	Install a policy
6.	Test a web connection to the Public Application IP (External Load Balancer IP) and monitor the Smart Console logs

### Module  6 –  Optional Lab: Troubleshooting and Scaling Issues 


Troubleshooting CME and/or autoprovision process on the Management Station

1.	Log into the export mode on the Management station.
2.	Issue an echo command:

`echo “****** Start Debug ******” >> /var/log/CPcme/cme.log`

This prints a debug starting point to the file.


3.	Issue the autoprovision test or cme test script.

```shell
service autoprovision test
service cme test
```

4.	Once the test scripts are completed issue an echo command to the /var/log/CPcme/cme.log or the $FWDIR/log/autoprovision.elg file as a debug stopping point


`CME	echo “****** Stop Debug ******” >> /var/log/CPcme/cme.log`


5.	Capture and review the following files.
- Console output 
- /var/log/CPcme/cme.log
- $FWDIR/conf/autoprovision.json
- The output of autoprov-cfg –v

**Addition Notes for CME debugging:**

To enable or disable Debug mode, run `cme_menu` and then select `Enable Debug mode`. 
Be aware that the Debug mode will ___significantly___ increase the number of logs written to the CME log files.


 
### Module  7 –  Optional Lab: Testing Scale-out


This test is used to confirm that the Azure scaling option is working as expected and that any new Check Point VMSS instances are created.

1.	Upload to each gateway the simulate CPU script from the CheckPoint-IaaS Github repository:
- https://github.com/CheckPointSW/CloudGuardIaaS/tree/master/common

2.	Assign the execute permission to the shell script:

```shell
[Expert@HostName:0] chmod u+x /var/tmp/simulate_cpu_load.sh
```

3.	Make sure there are no syntax mistakes in the shell script:

```shell
[Expert@HostName:0] sh -n /var/tmp/simulate_cpu_load.sh
```

4.	Execute the shell script to simulate a high CPU load:
```shell
[Expert@HostName:0] ./var/tmp/simulate_cpu_load.sh
```
5.	In another command-line shell, examine the current CPU load (must be at a high level):

```shell
[Expert@HostName:0] top
```

6.	After 10 minutes, a scale-out event is triggered. This creates a newly provisioned CloudGuard Security Gateway.
7.	After the new CloudGuard Security Gateways are provisioned, on the old CloudGuard Security Gateways press any key to stop the shell script.
8.	On the old CloudGuard Security Gateways, in another command-line shell, examine the current CPU load (must go back to a normal level):

```shell
[Expert@HostName:0] top
```

9.	After approximately 10 minutes, a scale-in event is triggered. This deletes the new CloudGuard Security Gateway.
